# Project Tuner for musical instruments implemented with R2R Digital Analog Converter

An electronical project hardware (PCB implementation, circuit components projection) & software implementation in Energia (a simplify framework from C++ very similar to Arduino) which converts sampled sounds generated by a code into real audible musical sounds/notes through a hardware digital to analog converter.
Development board: Microchip MSP430G2 LaunchPad

Digital-analog converter made up of a resistive R2R network. 
The DAC converter receives a 6-bit digital signal that it transforms into a single analog signal.

The signal is received at the output of the DAC by an operational amplifier (LM358) to filter it, then it is passed through an FTJ filter after which it is received by 2 amplifiers (LM358) arranged in antiphase for signal amplification.
The DAC converter receives a 6-bit digital signal that it transforms into a single analog signal/sound signal.

User interface

- For the user interface we used a 1602 LCD with we can view the menu
- 3 buttons to navigate the menu
- 6 LEDs, one for each bit of the DAC, to show which bits are active at certain times.
